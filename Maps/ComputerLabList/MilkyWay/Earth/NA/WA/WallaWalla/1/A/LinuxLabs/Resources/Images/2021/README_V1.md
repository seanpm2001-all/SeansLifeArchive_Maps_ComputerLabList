# Linux Labs

This is my personal computer lab, the name is used to represent it being an all Linux lab. 

## Details about the sign (V1)

The sign for this lab was made in less than 20 minutes, and contains some errors (that I regret making, as I haven't recreated it) and also uses the Aperture Science logo. It was late at night and I wasn't too focused. This is surprisingly good for something made with a sharpee and 4-5 crayons.

Some random Japanese and Korean text/syllables are used as an extra, a GNU typo was made multiple times (I tried to make it as small as possible as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the GNU+Linux joke) and poorly drawn Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux logos are used, along with a very poorly drawn anti-Windows icon.

Computer was accidentally spelled Computor, and I couldn't fix it, so I crossed it out and named it `STEM lab` (**S**cience **T**echnology **E**ngineering and **M**athematics) I feel it fits better.

The Greek letter Capital Omega (Î©) was used, but was converted into a magnet. This was an extra.
